Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap
To kiss the tender inward of thy hand
Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap
At the woods boldness by thee blushing stand
To be so tickled they would change their state
And situation with those dancing chips
Oer whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait
Making dead wood more blest than living lips
Since saucy jacks so happy are in this
Give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss
The expense of spirit in a waste of shame
Is lust in action and till action lust
Is perjured murderous bloody full of blame
Savage extreme rude cruel not to trust
Enjoyd no sooner but despised straight
Past reason hunted and no sooner had
Past reason hated as a swallowd bait
On purpose laid to make the taker mad
Mad in pursuit and in possession so
Had having and in quest to have extreme
A bliss in proof and proved a very woe
Before a joy proposed behind a dream
All this the world well knows yet none knows well
To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell
My mistress eyes are nothing like the sun
Coral is far more red than her lips red
If snow be white why then her breasts are dun
If hairs be wires black wires grow on her head
I have seen roses damaskd red and white
But no such roses see I in her cheeks
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks
I love to hear her speak yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound
I grant I never saw a goddess go
My mistress when she walks treads on the ground
And yet by heaven I think my love as rare
As any she belied with false compare
Thou art as tyrannous so as thou art
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel
For well thou knowst to my dear doting heart
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel
Yet in good faith some say that thee behold
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan
To say they err I dare not be so bold
Although I swear it to myself alone
And to be sure that is not false I swear
A thousand groans but thinking on thy face
One on anothers neck do witness bear
Thy black is fairest in my judgments place
In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds
And thence this slander as I think proceeds
Thine eyes I love and they as pitying me
Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain
Have put on black and loving mourners be
Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain
And truly not the morning sun of heaven
Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east
Nor that full star that ushers in the even
Doth half that glory to the sober west
As those two mourning eyes become thy face
O let it then as well beseem thy heart
To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace
And suit thy pity like in every part
Then will I swear beauty herself is black
And all they foul that thy complexion lack
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me
Ist not enough to torture me alone
But slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be
Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken
And my next self thou harder hast engrossd
Of him myself and thee I am forsaken
A torment thrice threefold thus to be crossd
Prison my heart in thy steel bosoms ward
But then my friends heart let my poor heart bail
Whoeer keeps me let my heart be his guard
Thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol
And yet thou wilt for I being pent in thee
Perforce am thine and all that is in me
So now I have confessd that he is thine
And I myself am mortgaged to thy will
Myself Ill forfeit so that other mine
Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still
But thou wilt not nor he will not be free
For thou art covetous and he is kind
He learnd but surety-like to write for me
Under that bond that him as fast doth bind
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take
Thou usurer that putst forth all to use
And sue a friend came debtor for my sake
So him I lose through my unkind abuse
Him have I lost thou hast both him and me
He pays the whole and yet am I not free
Whoever hath her wish thou hast thy Will
And Will to boot and Will in overplus
More than enough am I that vex thee still
To thy sweet will making addition thus
Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine
Shall will in others seem right gracious
And in my will no fair acceptance shine
The sea all water yet receives rain still
And in abundance addeth to his store
So thou being rich in Will add to thy Will
One will of mine to make thy large Will more
Let no unkind no fair beseechers kill
Think all but one and me in that one Will
If thy soul check thee that I come so near
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy Will
And will thy soul knows is admitted there
Thus far for love my love-suit sweet fulfil
Will will fulfil the treasure of thy love
Ay fill it full with wills and my will one
In things of great receipt with ease we prove
Among a number one is reckond none
Then in the number let me pass untold
Though in thy stores account I one must be
For nothing hold me so it please thee hold
That nothing me a something sweet to thee
Make but my name thy love and love that still
And then thou lovest me for my name is Will
Thou blind fool Love what dost thou to mine eyes
That they behold and see not what they see
They know what beauty is see where it lies
Yet what the best is take the worst to be
If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks
Be anchord in the bay where all men ride
Why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks
Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied
Why should my heart think that a several plot
Which my heart knows the wide worlds common place
Or mine eyes seeing this say this is not
To put fair truth upon so foul a face
In things right true my heart and eyes have erred
And to this false plague are they now transferrd
When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her though I know she lies
That she might think me some untutord youth
Unlearned in the worlds false subtleties
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
Although she knows my days are past the best
Simply I credit her false speaking tongue
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressd
But wherefore says she not she is unjust
And wherefore say not I that I am old
O loves best habit is in seeming trust
And age in love loves not to have years told
Therefore I lie with her and she with me
And in our faults by lies we flatterd be
O call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue
Use power with power and slay me not by art
Tell me thou lovest elsewhere but in my sight
Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside
What needst thou wound with cunning when thy might
Is more than my oer-pressd defense can bide
Let me excuse thee ah my love well knows
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies
And therefore from my face she turns my foes
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries
Yet do not so but since I am near slain
Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain
Be wise as thou art cruel do not press
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain
Lest sorrow lend me words and words express
The manner of my pity-wanting pain
If I might teach thee wit better it were
Though not to love yet love to tell me so
As testy sick men when their deaths be near
No news but health from their physicians know
For if I should despair I should grow mad
And in my madness might speak ill of thee
Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad
Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be
That I may not be so nor thou belied
Bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide
In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes
For they in thee a thousand errors note
But tis my heart that loves what they despise
Who in despite of view is pleased to dote
Nor are mine ears with thy tongues tune delighted
Nor tender feeling to base touches prone
Nor taste nor smell desire to be invited
To any sensual feast with thee alone
But my five wits nor my five senses can
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee
Who leaves unswayd the likeness of a man
Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be
Only my plague thus far I count my gain
That she that makes me sin awards me pain
Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate
Hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving
O but with mine compare thou thine own state
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving
Or if it do not from those lips of thine
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments
And seald false bonds of love as oft as mine
Robbd others beds revenues of their rents
Be it lawful I love thee as thou lovest those
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee
Root pity in thy heart that when it grows
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be
If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide
By self-example mayst thou be denied
Lo as a careful housewife runs to catch
One of her featherd creatures broke away
Sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay
Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase
Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
To follow that which flies before her face
Not prizing her poor infants discontent
So runnst thou after that which flies from thee
Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind
But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me
And play the mothers part kiss me be kind
So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will
If thou turn back and my loud crying still
Two loves I have of comfort and despair
Which like two spirits do suggest me still
The better angel is a man right fair
The worser spirit a woman colourd ill
To win me soon to hell my female evil
Tempteth my better angel from my side
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil
Wooing his purity with her foul pride
And whether that my angel be turnd fiend
Suspect I may but not directly tell
But being both from me both to each friend
I guess one angel in anothers hell
Yet this shall I neer know but live in doubt
Till my bad angel fire my good one out
Those lips that Loves own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said I hate
To me that languishd for her sake
But when she saw my woeful state
Straight in her heart did mercy come
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
Was used in giving gentle doom
And taught it thus anew to greet
I hate she alterd with an end
That followd it as gentle day
Doth follow night who like a fiend
From heaven to hell is flown away
I hate from hate away she threw
And saved my life saying not you
Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth
these rebel powers that thee array
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay
Why so large cost having so short a lease
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
Shall worms inheritors of this excess
Eat up thy charge is this thy bodys end
Then soul live thou upon thy servants loss
And let that pine to aggravate thy store
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross
Within be fed without be rich no more
So shalt thou feed on Death that feeds on men
And Death once dead theres no more dying then
My love is as a fever longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill
The uncertain sickly appetite to please
My reason the physician to my love
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept
Hath left me and I desperate now approve
Desire is death which physic did except
Past cure I am now reason is past care
And frantic-mad with evermore unrest
My thoughts and my discourse as madmens are
At random from the truth vainly expressd
For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright
Who art as black as hell as dark as night
O me what eyes hath Love put in my head
Which have no correspondence with true sight
Or if they have where is my judgment fled
That censures falsely what they see aright
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote
What means the world to say it is not so
If it be not then love doth well denote
Loves eye is not so true as all mens No
How can it O how can Loves eye be true
That is so vexd with watching and with tears
No marvel then though I mistake my view
The sun itself sees not till heaven clears
O cunning Love with tears thou keepst me blind
Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find
Canst thou O cruel say I love thee not
When I against myself with thee partake
Do I not think on thee when I forgot
Am of myself all tyrant for thy sake
Who hateth thee that I do call my friend
On whom frownst thou that I do fawn upon
Nay if thou lourst on me do I not spend
Revenge upon myself with present moan
What merit do I in myself respect
That is so proud thy service to despise
When all my best doth worship thy defect
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes
But love hate on for now I know thy mind
Those that can see thou lovest and I am blind
O from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway
To make me give the lie to my true sight
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill
That in the very refuse of thy deeds
There is such strength and warrantize of skill
That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more
The more I hear and see just cause of hate
O though I love what others do abhor
With others thou shouldst not abhor my state
If thy unworthiness raised love in me
More worthy I to be beloved of thee
Love is too young to know what conscience is
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love
Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss
Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove
For thou betraying me I do betray
My nobler part to my gross bodys treason
My soul doth tell my body that he may
Triumph in love flesh stays no father reason
But rising at thy name doth point out thee
As his triumphant prize Proud of this pride
He is contented thy poor drudge to be
To stand in thy affairs fall by thy side
No want of conscience hold it that I call
Her love for whose dear love I rise and fall
In loving thee thou knowst I am forsworn
But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing
In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn
In vowing new hate after new love bearing
But why of two oaths breach do I accuse thee
When I break twenty I am perjured most
For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee
And all my honest faith in thee is lost
For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness
Oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy
And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness
Or made them swear against the thing they see
For I have sworn thee fair more perjured eye
To swear against the truth so foul a lie
Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep
A maid of Dians this advantage found
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
In a cold valley-fountain of that ground
Which borrowd from this holy fire of Love
A dateless lively heat still to endure
And grew a seething bath which yet men prove
Against strange maladies a sovereign cure
But at my mistress eye Loves brand new-fired
The boy for trial needs would touch my breast
I sick withal the help of bath desired
And thither hied a sad distemperd guest
But found no cure the bath for my help lies
Where Cupid got new fire--my mistress eyes
The little Love-god lying once asleep
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand
Whilst many nymphs that vowd chaste life to keep
Came tripping by but in her maiden hand
The fairest votary took up that fire
Which many legions of true hearts had warmd
And so the general of hot desire
Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmd
This brand she quenched in a cool well by
Which from Loves fire took heat perpetual
Growing a bath and healthful remedy
For men diseased but I my mistress thrall
Came there for cure and this by that I prove
Loves fire heats water water cools not love
